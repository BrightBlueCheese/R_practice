# check how many common rows between the gapminder and the mortality
length(intersect(tb_gapMinder_2020$name, tb_childMortality_2020$name)) # total 184 intersects
      # Which means the the mortality table contains the whole countries that the gapminder has

# check how many common rows between the gapminder and the fertility
length(intersect(tb_gapMinder_2020$name, tb_totalFertility_2020$name)) # total 184
      # Good to go

# check how many common rows between the gapminder and the population
length(intersect(tb_gapMinder_2020$name, tb_population_2020$name)) # total 184
      # Good to go

# check how many common rows between the mortality and the population
length(intersect(tb_childMortality_2020$name, tb_population_2020$name)) # total 197
      # Awesome!
      ## Since the fertility and population in 2020 share the whole countries as intersect,
      ## It is reasonable to keep these whole 197 data into the gapminder.
      ## We could produce some meaning full result from the mortality and the population.
      ## While the fertility dataset has too many rows which are not in common to the others.
      ## So, we don't need the rest of the data except those in common
